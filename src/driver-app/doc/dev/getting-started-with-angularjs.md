# Getting started with AngularJS
## Introduction

Angular is a client-side MVC framework developed in JavaScript. Angular has a pretty short learning curve that is mainly to understand the terminology and "MVC" (Model-View-Controller) thinking.

### Model

data structure representing an entity of the application, usually transmitted in JSON. To start with Angular, some notions of JSON are necessary, this will allow you to communicate your server and your views.

### View

The view is simple, it's your HTML file. When using an MVC framework, you use data from the Model to update the View, so display the right information in your HTML.

### Controller

The controllers allow your server to communicate with the view, it's the messenger, so you can update your data via these communication channels between the server (cloud for us) and the client.
