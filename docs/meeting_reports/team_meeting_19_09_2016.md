Meeting report 19.9.16 App meeting
Participated: Aurelien, Perttu, Anil, Hanning, Tanja

Tasks given:
Tanja: Try if Gitter works, check waffle, find out about parking law (especially the fining part), write meeting report
Hanning: create a rough storyboard
Aurelien: create a mind map about the interaction of the beacons, apps and parking meter

Topics discussed:
The application creation.
How the appliances interact. What order, what interacts with what.
In which order does the user do things, what does he/she do?  ( both driver app and attendant app)

Decisions:
Most likely no user accounts needed. App saves info about car and sends that info as a request.
We make a storyboard and mindmap about the interactions between appliances to communicate our understanding of the project to the customer. This way the feedback we get will be more concrete.

Things we need to find out about:
Interaction order between meter, app and beacon
Do we need to make sure the car is parked before payment? (if not parked there might be mismatch between real world and the information the meter/service has). If need to make sure, how?

Questions for the customer:
Is parking attendant app interacting with the beacons or the parking meter? (situation is differs in areas where there are parking meters and places where there are not)
Should we make organization for github?
Show storyboard and interaction mindmap and ask opinions
Discuss about importance order of the features.
