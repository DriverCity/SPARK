# Meeting notes 24.11.16

## Decisions:
### attendant app:
* can choose the area on a list or on a map or get the area from the smart meter.
* show cars on that area and cars detected from other areas separately  

### driver app: 
* the disc parking arrival time will be set on exact time of arrival.
* at this point it is fine if the driver can extend the disk parking time from a distance
