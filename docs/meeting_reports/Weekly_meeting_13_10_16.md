# SPARK meeting notes 13.10

Attending: Bill Silverajan, Soumya Das, Hanning Zhau, Aur√©lien Wolz, Perttu Paarlahti, Tanja Lehtovaara  

## General decisions:
* use gitter for communication instead of email, also communicate to the customer earlier
* weekly reports should be added to Github
* as week 42 is an exam week, weekly meeting with customer is only held if there is a need for it.
  
## Things to do in near future:
* send project plan to customer
* make UI mockups of the apps

## Decisions about requirements:
* Paid outside parking and the attandant story are the first priority
* The benefit for the driver has to be thought about in more detail. Can also be a future scenario
* The customer approved the requirements, but we should add more usability requirments (driver app should be easy to use,
Attendant app can be more sophistocated) and the benefit for the driver

## Other things disussed:
* how to prevent forgeries, Kerberos?
* demonstrated early version of the map application
* It would be beneficial to be able to interview an attendant (for example to find out how they determine the route of checking cars)
