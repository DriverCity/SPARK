#SPARK meeting notes 3.11

##Topics discussed:
* Show updated UIs
* updated user stories
* show test results for beacon
* minimun requirements
* stories to be implemented in sprint 2

##Decisions about attendant app:
* add he option to choose area for paid parking
* at this point indicating violations and non-violations is enough. We will consider other options if there is time.
* setting the time limit should be digital (or othervise able to show the time in enough detail and allow a long enough time)
* the driver gives info about car that the attendant can use to find the car while checking
* if there is no data in the cloud corresponding to the register number scanned by the attendadnt the register number 
will not be shown on the attendant app's list of cars.
(To eliminate other devices from showing on the application.) (not first priority)

##Other decisions:
* user stories OK
* test results OK
* stories for next sprint will be determined by the team
* minimun requirements will be discussed further and no decisions were made so far
* try to find a way to give Bill and Antti access to the interactive prototypes.
