# Meeting notes 17.11.2016

## Decisions:
* Use stripe as an exapmle of payment method, but only simulate the payment
* If meter to could connection is not working the payment token can be stored in the meter. But dealing with this is not the priority.
* Generally, dealing with all the cases where there can be an error (internet noy workin etc) are not priority.
More important is to document that this situation may happen.
* IPR belogs to the team
* add new version of project plan to github after it has been fully updated
