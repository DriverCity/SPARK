# Meeting notes

##Documentation
* focus on helping others to use our work (use and develop further)
* this means: overview descripion, installation instructions, how it works, code documetation (code commenting: what functions do etc.)

## Other decisions:
* while thinking about the algorithm of prediction would be good to also think about how to generate the data used for that.
* if we have a chance to meet an attendant we can show them what we did (no requirement for user testing)
* customer approved the minimum requirements as fulfilled.
* next meeting initially on 2nd Feb for final demo.
